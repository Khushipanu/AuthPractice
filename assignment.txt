Q: 1
L0: Simple User Signup & Login API
Objective:
Develop an API that allows users to sign up and log in using JWT-based authentication. ✅ Passwords must be hashed during signup using bcrypt for secure storage.

Schema Details:
users Collection
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true },
  password: String // ✅ Store hashed password
});
Routes & Access Control:
1️ Authentication Routes
POST /signup → Hash the password using bcrypt and register a new user.
POST /login → Authenticate the user by comparing the hashed password and generate a JWT token.

2️ Middleware for Authentication
Auth Middleware (authMiddleware.js) → Verifies JWT and attaches user info to req.user.
Expected Outcomes:
Users can sign up with their password securely hashed.
Users can log in with valid credentials.
A JWT token is returned upon successful login.
Unauthorized users cannot access protected routes.
